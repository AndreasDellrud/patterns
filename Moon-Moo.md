## Meaning

Moon-Moo honors the 30th King of the Silla Dynasty. His body was buried near Dae Wang Am (Great King's Rock). According to his will, his body was placed in the sea "where my soul shall forever defend my land against the Japanese." It is said that the Sok Gul Am (Stone Cave) was built to guard his tomb, and it remains a fine example of the Silla Dynasty's culture. The 61 movements in this pattern symbolize the last two figures of 661 A.D., when Moon Moo ascended the throne.
